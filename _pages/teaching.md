Methodological Toolkit

· 🎙️ Ethnography & Linguistic Anthropology: Participant-observation, semi-structured interviews, and community-based research practices.

· 📚 Corpus Linguistics & Language Documentation: Building and annotating multimedia, geolocalized linguistic corpora from fieldwork data.

· 🗺️ Spatial Humanities & GIS: Using GIS software (QGIS/ArcGIS) for digital mapping and the analysis of spatial patterns in cultural data.

· 💻 Computational Sociolinguistics & NLP: Applying NLP models for quantitative text analysis, pattern recognition, and data visualization.

Illustrative Project: The Peninsular Surf Atlas

To illustrate how I integrate these interests and methodologies, a project I am currently developing is the "Peninsular Surf Atlas." This project proposes the first comparative digital ethnography of two of Spain's foundational surf communities: Somo, Cantabria, and Zarautz, Basque Country.

The core of the project is the creation of an interactive, geolocalized corpus to explore how a shared global identity is shaped by distinct local sociolinguistic and cultural practices. This "digital atlas" would combine ethnographic data with computational analysis, serving as a new type of open-access resource for cultural analytics.

I am passionate about this line of inquiry and I am eager to develop and refine this or similar research projects under the guidance of a faculty advisor whose expertise can help shape its final direction.
