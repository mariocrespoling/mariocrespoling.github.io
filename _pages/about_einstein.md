My fascination with how communities create meaning through language began in my linguistics degree at the Complutense University of Madrid. This led me to explore the technical tools to analyze it at scale, through intensive training at MITx and my work with the ACL. My fieldwork in the north of Spain confirmed my passion for ethnography, and my academic experiences in Belgium, Finland, Poland, and Italy broadened my european perspective. Now, I aim to synthesize these skills —linguistics, data science, and ethnography— to explore the vibrant global subculture of surfing.

When I'm not working on my research, you can probably find me trying to understand that culture firsthand. 🏄‍♂️
